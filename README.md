Just a simple old school debug class I use sometimes.

Dumps data and backtrace using print_r to screen or logfile.

You probably should not try to use this silly old script even once, because it may make you addicted to print_r and tailing debug logs. 

to install: 
composer require --dev "pa-ulander/debug @dev"
